# Dataset
In the following, we provide file structure, camera coordinate system, data generation details for two datasets: Replica, Tanks&Temple.
## 📷 Camera Coordinate System 
In all datasets, the camera coordinate system follows that in project: [NeRF in PyTorch3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/tree/main/projects/nerf), which follows the PyTorch3D convention. The figure below illustrate the axis orientation in each coordinate system, please refer to PyTorch3D [official document](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/docs/notes/cameras.md) for configuration and usage details.
