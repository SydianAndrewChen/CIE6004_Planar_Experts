# Dataset
In the following, we provide file structure, camera coordinate system, data generation details for two datasets: Replica, Tanks&Temple.
## üì∑ Camera Coordinate System 
In all datasets, the camera coordinate system follows that in project: [NeRF in PyTorch3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/tree/main/projects/nerf), which follows the PyTorch3D convention. The figure below illustrate the axis orientation in each coordinate system, please refer to PyTorch3D [official document](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/docs/notes/cameras.md) for configuration and usage details.

## üõãÔ∏è Replica
### Data Generation
The Replica dataset is composed of several indoor scenes, and we generate data of 7 distint scenes for training and evaluation. First of all, we download Replica Dataset from the [official repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Replica-Dataset)$^1$. The camera views, RGB images, depth map are sampled with rendering engine [BlenderProc](https://github.com/DLR-RM/BlenderProc)$^2$, which provides an interactive viewing interface and data generation pipeline. The figure below illustrates the camera poses distribution. For each scene, we sample 50 training views (<font color=blue>blue dots</font>) and reconstruct point cloud with [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/) $^{3,4}$. In addition, we sample another 100 novel views (<font color=red>red dots</font>) of much wider viewing range for evaluation. As a result, the data is able to validate the extrapolation capability.
